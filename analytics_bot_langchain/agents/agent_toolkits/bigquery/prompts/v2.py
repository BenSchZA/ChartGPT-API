"""Scratchpad
- The BigQuery project ID is accessed using: `bigquery_client.project`
- The list of BigQuery dataset IDs are accessed using: `dataset_ids = [dataset.dataset_id for dataset in bigquery_client.list_datasets()]`
- The list of BigQuery table IDs are accessed using: `table_ids = [table.table_id for table in bigquery_client.list_tables(dataset_id)]`
- e.g. `{project_id}.{dataset_id}.{table_id}`

- Always check what columns are available for a specific table before constructing a query

- Handling case sensitivity, e.g. using ILIKE instead of LIKE
- Ensuring the join columns are correct
- Casting values to the appropriate type
- Properly quoting identifiers when required (e.g. table.`Sales Amount`)

- Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question.
- Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
- If it is a plot request, do not forget to import streamlit as st and at the end of the script use st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True) to display the plot

You have access to the following datasets, tables, and columns:
```

Tips:
- BigQuery project ID: {project_id}
- Table name: `project_id.dataset_id.table_id`
- Column names: `tables_summary[dataset_id][table_id]`
- Create a Pandas df of SQL query results: `df = bigquery_client.query(query).to_dataframe()`.
- Plot charts using `st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)` at the end of your python script

# - Sort the df with `df.sort_values(...)` when required.
# - Use PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) OVER (ORDER BY column_name) when requested for Median.
